For initial authorization, 6 week maximum for 12 or 24 week regimen (in order to be eligible for the maximum number of tablets, member must meet both initial and reauthorization criteria). For reauthorization: A. Initial authorization criteria above has been met, AND B. HCV RNA levels have declined > 2 log 10IU/mL at 4 weeks of therapy. Note: There are no treatment guidelines or FDA-approved therapies for re-treatment with Viekira Pak after failure of a Viekira Pak regimen. APPLIES TO Altius, Coventry Healthcare, HealthAmerica, Preferred Health Systems - Pegasys(pegylated interferon alfa-2a) is the CHC preferred pegylated interferon product. New starts on pegylated interferon must use Pegasys. NON-COVERAGE Coverage will NOT be granted for the following: 1. Use not approved by the FDA, 2. The use is unapproved and not supported by the literature or evidence as an accepted off-label use. (see Off-Label Use Policy for determining â€˜accepted useâ€™) 3. Use of maintenance interferon or peg-interferon for chronic suppression of HCV. Results of these trials have indicated that there is no benefit to this therapeutic approach and therefore it will not be covered. 4. Treatment of HCV with ribavirin monotherapy is not effective and not covered. 5. Treatment of HCV with Victrelis / Incivek monotherapy or not in combination with peg-interferon and ribavirin has not been studied. Retreatment in patients previously failed NS3/4A protease inhibitor (Victrelis, Incivek, Olysio) in combination with peg-interferon and ribavirin should not be retreated with another NS3/4A protease inhibitor."}]';
